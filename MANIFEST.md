# ~/.claude/ File Manifest

Classifies every file as USER (our customizations, never overwritten), SYSTEM (from plugins/upstream, safe to update), or GENERATED (ephemeral, never versioned).

## USER — Our Customizations (tracked in lifeOS)

| `commands/pr.md` | /pr — create PR, Copilot reminder |
| `commands/branch.md` | /branch — feature branch from main |
| `commands/push.md` | /push — push, never force |
| `commands/fix-pr-feedback.md` | /fix-pr-feedback — adversarial bridge |
| `commands/README.md` | Command index with versions and dependencies |
